#$ cd /home/roboshop
#$ unzip /tmp/catalogue.zip
#$ mv catalogue-main catalogue
#$ cd /home/roboshop/catalogue
#$ npm install
#
#```
#

#
#Update `MONGO_DNSNAME` with MongoDB Server IP
#
#2. Now, lets set up the service with systemctl.
#
#```bash
#  # mv /home/roboshop/catalogue/systemd.service /etc/systemd/system/catalogue.service
#  # systemctl daemon-reload
#  # systemctl start catalogue
#  # systemctl enable catalogue
#
#```
